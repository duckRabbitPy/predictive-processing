Then in a series of short videos I\u2019m going to explore some of the key concepts covered in the books and talk about some of the implications of the theory.

The first book is by Andy Clark, published 2016 and it\u2019s called Surfing Uncertainty. This was my first introduction to predictive processing and right from the start I recognised that this is a book that requires a close reading, there are some parts of the book, particularly the section on movement and action that are pretty tough going. However, on the whole I found the topic of predictive processing fascinating, and it was something new and refreshing for me.

I also was impressed by the lengths that Clark had gone to properly support his claims and offer opportunities for further reading. I mean there\u2019s like 40 pages of references at the end of the book which is pretty mad for a fairly short book. 

But after finishing Surfing Uncertainty, I was left with the feeling that I needed to read more about predictive processing, before moving on to this further reading, and was looking for an introductory book by another author so I could get a different perspective on the topic. So, I looked online and the predictive mind by Hohwy had good reviews and was a natural choice. I found Howhy\u2019s style of writing easier to understand and it was a nice read, and it helped me to consolidate what I had learnt from Clark. 

I\u2019d give both books 4 out of 5 stars and they are definitely worth reading if you\u2019re interested in the more empirical side of the philosophy of mind.  But given the chance I would have read the predictive mind first.

Ok so what is predictive processing?
`),S=o("br"),b=o("br"),E=y(`

Predictive processing is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment. 

And under this theory What we perceive is determined by the currently best performing predictions.

This can be nicely summed up by the following quote:

\u201CPerception is a controlled hallucination.\u201D
This sounds fairly radical but when you look at the details of the theory, it seems to all fit together quite nicely.

`),g=o("br"),l=o("br"),m=y(`
So, what is the theory up against?
`),w=o("br"),k=o("br"),s=y(`

Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device. By contrast, predictive processing emphasizes the constructive nature of perception, viewing perception as an active and highly selective process.


`),B=o("br"),_=o("br"),q=y(`
Now let\u2019s start to look at the origins of the theory. 

In many ways our brain is like a person trapped a box. 

It has no direct access to the causes out there in the world, it only has access to the effects of those causes on the senses.

Therefore, the brain relies on inference to get a grip on the causal structure on the world.
Inferences about causes are made using available sensory evidence.

Some of you may notice this statement sounds a bit similar to Immanuel Kant\u2019s assertions about things-in-themselves. There might be something to this and if you\u2019re interested there is a link to a paper in the video description that positions Kant as the forefather of predictive processing.

In the last video I started introducing predictive processing as a theory that views the brain as an inference machine, constantly engaging in predictions and revising predictive models in light of new evidence, with the best inferences determining the content of our perception. 

But how does the brain make good inferences?

`),x=o("br"),P=o("br"),R=y(`

The theory posits that the brain utilizes a statistical method using Bayes\u2019 theorem to update the probability of our hypotheses about causes, as more evidence becomes available. 

The key idea is that the best inference is one with the highest posterior probability. This is calculated by considering how likely it is that your hypothesis would produce the evidence you observe: e.g. If I was in a house and heard a muffled bang, if my hypothesis was that it was a bird hitting the window, the likelihood is the probability that a bird hitting the window would make that the sound that I heard. 

The likelihood on its own is not that informative. Because the same effect could have multiple different causes, in this instance the muffled sound could be exactly the sort of sound that a small UFO crashing into the house would sound like. 

`),T=o("br"),f=o("br"),$=y(`

So, the likelihood is considered alongside the probability of your hypothesis independently of the evidence. This is known as the prior. In this example the prior is the probability of a bird hitting my window at this time of day.

Using this information and applying Bayes theorem we can calculate the posterior probability of each hypothesis.

As you acquire more evidence e.g. Additional banging sounds of increasing frequency, hypotheses can be quickly re-ranked in order of posterior probability. In this case the posterior probability of the sound being caused by, my neighbour banging on the window would dramatically increase with each knock.`),this.h()},l(S){e=r(S,"P",{class:!0});var b=A(e);i=r(b,"STRONG",{});var E=A(i);n=v(E,"Transcript:"),E.forEach(I),a=z(b),p=r(b,"BR",{}),h=r(b,"BR",{}),u=v(b,`
