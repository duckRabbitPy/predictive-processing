<div class="about-me">
	<p>
		My name's Oli, i'm glad you found this page! I'm interested in the philosophy and neuroscience
		of the mind, particularly questions centered around perception, belief, intention, meaning and
		mental health. I feel drawn towards a school of pragmatism, influenced by the writing of Ludwig
		Wittgenstein, Richard Rorty, Daniel Dennett and Robert Brandom.
		<br /><br />
		Not long ago I stumbled across the terms 'predictive processing' and 'predictive coding' in the books
		of Andy Clark and Jakob Howhy and ever since I've been fascinated by the rich work in this field.
		<br /><br />
		This site is a repository of resources I have found, youtube videos I have made and a space for the
		thoughts I have on predictive processing. I mainly made this site for myself, but I hope you find
		something of interest.
		<br /><br />
