In this video I’m going to talk about a couple of really interesting books that I’ve read recently that introduce the topic of predictive processing. Then in a series of short videos I’m going to explore some of the key concepts covered in the books and talk about some of the implications of the theory. 

The two books that I’m going to focus on are written by philosophers that have been closely following developments in cognitive neuroscience. 

<br><br>
The first book is by Andy Clark, published 2016 and it’s called Surfing Uncertainty. This was my first introduction to predictive processing and right from the start I recognised that this is a book that requires a close reading, there are some parts of the book, particularly the section on movement and action that are pretty tough going. However, on the whole I found the topic of predictive processing fascinating, and it was something new and refreshing for me.

I also was impressed by the lengths that Clark had gone to properly support his claims and offer opportunities for further reading. I mean there’s like 40 pages of references at the end of the book which is pretty mad for a fairly short book. 

But after finishing Surfing Uncertainty, I was left with the feeling that I needed to read more about predictive processing, before moving on to this further reading, and was looking for an introductory book by another author so I could get a different perspective on the topic. So, I looked online and the predictive mind by Hohwy had good reviews and was a natural choice. I found Howhy’s style of writing easier to understand and it was a nice read, and it helped me to consolidate what I had learnt from Clark. 

I’d give both books 4 out of 5 stars and they are definitely worth reading if you’re interested in the more empirical side of the philosophy of mind.  But given the chance I would have read the predictive mind first. 

<br><br>
Ok so what is predictive processing?
<br><br>

Predictive processing is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment. 

And under this theory What we perceive is determined by the currently best performing predictions.

This can be nicely summed up by the following quote:

“Perception is a controlled hallucination.”
This sounds fairly radical but when you look at the details of the theory, it seems to all fit together quite nicely.

<br><br>
So, what is the theory up against?
<br><br>

Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device. By contrast, predictive processing emphasizes the constructive nature of perception, viewing perception as an active and highly selective process.


<br><br>
Now let’s start to look at the origins of the theory. 

In many ways our brain is like a person trapped a box. 

It has no direct access to the causes out there in the world, it only has access to the effects of those causes on the senses.

Therefore, the brain relies on inference to get a grip on the causal structure on the world.
Inferences about causes are made using available sensory evidence.

Some of you may notice this statement sounds a bit similar to Immanuel Kant’s assertions about things-in-themselves. There might be something to this and if you’re interested there is a link to a paper in the video description that positions Kant as the forefather of predictive processing.

Take a moment to look at this image. 

If you have never seen this image before it may appear as a random collection of dots and splodges.

But after you “discover” the dalmatian dog, it is difficult to unsee it. In fact, the dog will “pop out” within seconds of looking at the picture for the rest of your lifetime. 

Why is this relevant? This type of image is reflective of the sort of sensory information that we constantly receive, the retina is constantly receiving a barrage of dots and splodges, shadows, half occluded moving forms and flashing lights. 

Buried within the noise are statistical regularities that can help us build hypotheses about the causes of the sensory data.

<br><br>
The winning hypothesis is what we perceive, we perceive the dalmatian and continue to do so for many years because it is our brain’s best inference from the sensory evidence.

In my next video I’m going to introduce the mechanism in predictive processing that enables the brain to make the best inferences.
