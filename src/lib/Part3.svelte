The signal-noise ratio from the environment is in constant flux. Sometimes the sensory input is noisy and uncertain such as in low light conditions, busy pubs and bustling restaurants.

Based on contextual cues the brain can estimate how precise the input from below is likely to be and use neuromodulation to change the gain on prediction error units. 

High precision expectations increase the gain on prediction error units, which drives prediction errors up the hierarchy. 

In contrast, when there is a low expectation for precision prediction error will not make its way to higher areas and therefore top-down predictions are given inordinate weight in perceptual inference.

This is helps explain why perceptual illusions and hallucinations are more common where sensory input is noisy for instance in a whispering crowd or a dark corner in the periphery of our vision.

Prediction processing has something important to say about attention and one of the slogans that is found in both Surfing Uncertainty and The predictive mind is:

Attention is nothing but optimisation of precision expectations.

What this means is that the focus of our attention is a way of us sampling data that we expect will be precise, and we turn up the gain on prediction error in that region. 

We sample the world for precise sensory information that will help us prove our current hypothesis, if there is a prediction error, this error is propagated to high areas in the brain due to the high gain on the prediction error units, which results in a revision of the current hypothesis.
