When there are low precision expectations there is a low gain on predictive error, therefore top-down predictions are given inordinate weight in perceptual inference.

Alterations in dopamine transmission in people who experience psychosis is one of the more robust findings in psychosis research and therefore it’s certainly interesting to know that dopamine is thought to play a vital role in regulating signal to noise ratio and precision expectations.

The predictive processing model of delusion formation begins when due to these disturbances sensory information is predicted to be less precise, noisier and more uncertain than it actually is. This decreases the gain on sensory input (less prediction errors propagating up hierarchy) and heightens the reliance on top down priors. 


The dampened down error signal is inefficient at regulating ongoing revision of prior beliefs meaning that priors are more likely to stray away from reality. 

<br><br>

In addition, relatively small (but significant) prediction errors are treated as noise instead of signal, so larger prediction errors may stand out as being exceptionally salient against the background of subdued prediction error.

This leads to improbable beliefs detached from reality and insulated from sensory evidence that would force revision.

Psychosis is then to be thought of as living in a world where the senses are expected to be imprecise and top down theories have undue influence on incoming senses. 

Delusions are then conceived of wild hypotheses permitted to reign unchecked by sensory evidence.

Hallucinations are not perceptions in the absence of sensory information, rather perceptions due to distrust in sensory information and an undue influence of prior expectations. 

There are many other topics under the banner of prediction processing, not least action and the motor system, emotion and consciousness. I may get round to do further videos, but I hope that I have set the scene enough for you to read Hohwy and Clark’s books for yourselves.

I’ve left some links in the description for further reading, so check those out if you’re interested.

I apologise if I’ve made any errors throughout these videos, I make no claim to be an expert, but in the spirit of predictive processing, do let me know so I can update my current model.
